BUILD binaries for Win32 systems.

These binaries are BETA quality. Expect crashes.

The notable annoyances:
1) No sound.
2) It's too slow (it's rendering 100+ frames per second here, but there's a
   bug in the animation timer, so it looks like it's running in Matrix mode).
3) No networking. Boohoo.   :)

Bug reports to Ryan C. Gordon (icculus@lokigames.com).

I've only tested this briefly on a Windows 98 (second edition) box. YMMV.
 Please feel free to report success and failure on different Windows platforms.
 This, obviously, will not work on a Windows 3.1 platform, for that one
 sadistic guy who's going to try it.  :)

This does not play Duke3D, Shadow Warrior, Blood, or any other game but Ken's
 test game ("KenBuild").

Do NOT harrass Ken Silverman about these binaries. He did not compile them.
 He did not release them. He did not port this to Windows and he does NOT want
 to hear from YOU.

Here is his license text stuff:

// "Build Engine & Tools" Copyright (c) 1993-1997 Ken Silverman
// Ken Silverman's official web site: "http://www.advsys.net/ken"
// See the included license file "BUILDLIC.TXT" for license info.
// This file has been modified from Ken Silverman's original release


This code also relies on Simple Directmedia Layer (SDL) for graphics and input.
 This excellent cross-platform library was put together by Sam Lantinga, and
 is available to us under the LGPL license. That means that I can use it
 freely, but I have to point you to a place where you can get the source
 for yourself:

   http://www.libsdl.org/


The source code of the Build port (along with screenshots of it running) is
available from http://www.icculus.org/

Feel free to send me comments, complaints, suggestions, and donations.

Enjoy!
