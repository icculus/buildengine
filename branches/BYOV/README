Do not expect much from the code. We are making progress, but as of yet:
 - The 2D editor seems to mostly work.
 - 3D mode is working more and more, but is incomplete in some ways.
 - Lots of stuff doesn't work correctly.
 - Lots of stuff downright doesn't work at all.


You NEED gcc 2.95.2 (or maybe later) to compile this code correctly.
You'll also need Netwide Assembler (NASM). Get it at:

  http://nasm.sourceforge.net/


PLEASE READ THE CHANGELOG AND TODO FILE FOR DETAILS ON WHAT'S NEW AND
 WHAT'S NEEDED! They're in the tarball.

Have fun!

INFO:
- Patches go to Ryan at icculus@lokigames.com. I'll put this in CVS later.
  For now, the latest source is at http://www.lokigames.com/~icculus/BUILD/
- Please try to keep it so the original source can still be compiled with
  Watcom C for DOS. Maybe if we do a good enough job, we can just get Ken
  to make this his official version, although this is not the goal right now.
  You may #ifdef DOSisms with PLATFORM_DOS, and Unixism with PLATFORM_UNIX, but
  try not to touch the original code if you can circumvent it (i.e. reimplement
  the functionality of missing functions in a separate file, #define
  __interrupt to be blank, etc...) Reference unix_compat.[ch] and sdl_driver.c
  for examples of this behaviour.
- See us in #loki at irc.openprojects.net with questions.
- This is NOT a Loki-sponsored project. We're Loki employees that get off on
  this stuff. Don't harrass info@lokigames.com about it.

TO PORT TO NEW PROCESSORS:
- You can either write new ASM for your processor, or better yet, implement
  the stuff in C, so everyone can benefit.
- Most of your work will be in pragmas.*, a_linux.*, and a.*.  Look for
  USE_I386_ASM. Define your own version.
