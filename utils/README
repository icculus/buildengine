README for BUILD Utils Package

These are the utilities Ken Silverman released along with his BUILD engine.
There is a quick description of what each of these do in the ureadme.txt file.
Most of the utilities in this package either don't work at all or don't work
correctly yet.  Normal users won't get much use out of this for now, but
there will hopefully be something interesting quite soon.

More info in the CHANGELOG and TODO files if you're a hacker and interested.
