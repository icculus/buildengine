README for BUILD Utils Package

These are Ken's utilities shipped with BUILD.  Your milage with them
will vary.  Most of them are waiting on a replacement for _dos_findfirst
and _dos_findnext before they will work.  All the ones that do work work
quite well.

More info in the CHANGELOG and TODO files if you're a hacker and interested.
