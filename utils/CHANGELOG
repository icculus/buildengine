CHANGELOG for BUILD Utils Package

08122000 - Initial release. kextract is the only utility that compiles cleanly,
	kgroup and the map conversion utilities will work fine once they get
	a findfirst/findnext implementation.  BUILD needs this too, so it may
	get done soon.  I haven't touched the rest of the utils yet, since they
	look like they'll need files from the BUILD source (pragmas.[ch], 
	unix_compat.[ch], etc), and I really don't feel like screwing with this
	anymore at the moment :)

08222000 - kgroup now works... realized that kextract has some problems. kgroup
	seems to have some too, but they are trivial, like files are sorted
	backwards alphabetically in the group file and such.  As far as I can
	tell, kgroup is stable.
