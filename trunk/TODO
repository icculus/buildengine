(questions to Ryan C. Gordon, icculus@clutteredmind.org)

NEXT ON TAP:
- extern "C" in every header.
- Litter the code with assertions.
- ASM->C port for non-intel boxes?
- Look for the string "!!!" ... these are TODOs in the source.
- Tie the window manager quit request to the program, so it reacts like an
  ESC in 3D mode, and a "ESC, Q" in 2D mode. This will allows the user to
  abort the shutdown, save if there are changes, etc...
- Make 2D mode only prompt to save changes on exit if there are changes to
  save.
- Looking up/down in the editor seems to screw things up. This might not be
  the case in 320x200 resolution. Look into it.
- Slopes are misdrawn in kensig.map.  (still?)
- Sound.
- Networking.
- Port to Visual C?
- Port to Mingwin32?  (the mprotect()s need to be #ifdef'd out. That should
  be the biggest change.)
- Port to BeOS?
- Make a statically linked binary option in the Linux Makefile.
- Make a linuxbins target (like msbins target) in the Linux Makefile.
- Hardware surface/page flipping for more rendering speed?
- Can we sync to vblank in SDL?
- OpenGL? This would accelerate rendering, get us out of 8-bit hell, make it
  prettier, and take out most of the ASM code, for porting to other processors.
  But it will also give us all ulcers.  :)
- Update Ken's docs, where applicable.
- Remove all possible global variables, and expose getter/setter functions
   instead.
- There's an SDL_UpdateRect() call in engine.c (__printext256().) Do something
   about it.
- Can we convert any existing tabs into equivalent spaces ASCII 32 chars, so
   the align at 4-space tabstops? Tabs suck.
- Can we move those SDL __cdecl pragmas out of display.h?
- Long filenames confuse the editor's file "dialog".
- boardfilename (and others) in build.c and elsewhere are hardcoded to 13 chars.
- Might be worth moving all that resolution management code from sdl_driver.c
   to engine.c ...

// end of TODO ...
