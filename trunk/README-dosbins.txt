BUILD binaries for DOS (i386 and greater) systems.

These binaries are BETA quality. Expect crashes.

Bug reports to Ryan C. Gordon (icculus@clutteredmind.org).

I've only tested this briefly on a Windows 98 (second edition) box, in a DOS
 window. YMMV.

Please feel free to report success and failure on different Windows platforms.

This does not play Duke3D, Shadow Warrior, Blood, or any other game but Ken's
 test game ("KenBuild"). It can sort of edit Duke3D maps, but the BUILD.EXE on
 your commercial Duke3D CD-ROM is better suited. You can also check out Mapster
 (http://mapster-rtcm.totalconversions.com/), which might be useful to you.

Do NOT harrass Ken Silverman about these binaries. He did not compile them.
 He did not release them. He is not maintaining this port and he does NOT want
 to hear from YOU.

Here is his license text stuff:

// "Build Engine & Tools" Copyright (c) 1993-1997 Ken Silverman
// Ken Silverman's official web site: "http://www.advsys.net/ken"
// See the included license file "BUILDLIC.TXT" for license info.
// This file has been modified from Ken Silverman's original release


The source code of the Build port (along with screenshots of it running) is
available from http://www.icculus.org/

Feel free to send me comments, complaints, suggestions, and donations.

Enjoy!
