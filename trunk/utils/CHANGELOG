CHANGELOG for BUILD Utils Package

08122000 - Initial release. kextract is the only utility that compiles cleanly,
	kgroup and the map conversion utilities will work fine once they get
	a findfirst/findnext implementation.  BUILD needs this too, so it may
	get done soon.  I haven't touched the rest of the utils yet, since they
	look like they'll need files from the BUILD source (pragmas.[ch], 
	unix_compat.[ch], etc), and I really don't feel like screwing with this
	anymore at the moment :)

08222000 - kgroup now works... realized that kextract has some problems. kgroup
	seems to have some too, but they are trivial, like files are sorted
	backwards alphabetically in the group file and such.  As far as I can
	tell, kgroup is stable.

09042000 - Christian Zander contributed a new (GPL'd) kextract from scratch,
	which I've named grpextract. It works under Linux, unlike kextract.
	Added Ken's license text.

09102000 - Editart now compiles (doesn't link yet).  Working on that, hopefully
	it will link soon, but a lot of work will still need to be done.  Ken
	used some VGA tricks that don't translate to SDL too well.  I don't
	doubt that it will immediately segfault once it links, but I guess
	we'll see.  Other stuff was done, mostly cleanups with the other utils,
	such as *_compat.h instead of duplicating a ton of code in each util.
	kextract still mystifies me, but that's not as important since we now
	have grpextract. Map utils still waiting for opendir stuff.
