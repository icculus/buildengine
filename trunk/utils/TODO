TODO for BUILD Utilities Package

- A findfirst()/findnext() implementation
- Utils that generate files should lowercase the names
- Fix some asm in editart.c
- Port setup to ncurses (is it even needed anymore?)
- Maybe a nice GTK+ front end to manage Group files?

As with the BUILD source, send patches to Ryan (icculus@lokigames.com)
