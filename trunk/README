You NEED gcc 2.95.2 (or maybe later) to compile this code correctly.
You'll also need Netwide Assembler (NASM). Get it at:

  http://nasm.sourceforge.net/


This code uses Simple Directmedia Layer (SDL) for graphics, sound, and other
platform abstractions. Build relies on a fairly recent SDL code snapshot.

Get SDL from CVS like this:

cvs -d :pserver:guest@cvs.lokigames.com:/cvs login
# password is "guest", without the quotes.
cvs -z3 -d :pserver:guest@cvs.lokigames.com:/cvs checkout -r devel_1_1_0 SDL
cd SDL; ./autogen.sh; make; make install


CVS is also good if you want the up-to-the-minute changes of BUILD:

cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@linux.ucla.edu:/var/cvs login
# password is "anonymous", without the quotes.
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@linux.ucla.edu:/var/cvs co buildengine


PLEASE READ THE CHANGELOG AND TODO FILE FOR DETAILS ON WHAT'S NEW AND
 WHAT'S NEEDED! They're in the tarball.

Have fun!

INFO:
- Patches go to Ryan at icculus@lokigames.com.
- Please try to keep it so the original source can still be compiled with
  Watcom C for DOS. Maybe if we do a good enough job, we can just get Ken
  to make this his official version, although this is not the goal right now.
  You may #ifdef DOSisms with PLATFORM_DOS, and Unixism with PLATFORM_UNIX, but
  try not to touch the original code if you can circumvent it (i.e. reimplement
  the functionality of missing functions in a separate file, #define
  __interrupt to be blank, etc...) Reference unix_compat.[ch] and sdl_driver.c
  for examples of this behaviour.
- See us in #loki at irc.openprojects.net with questions.
- This is NOT a Loki-sponsored project. We're Loki employees that get off on
  this stuff. Don't harrass info@lokigames.com about it.
- Yes, you CAN edit Duke3D maps with this, but I haven't tried extensively.
  Get your DUKE3D.GRP file, kextract *.map from it, and then rename it to
  stuff.dat. Open one of the extracted maps in BUILD, and it should work.
  I haven't tried Blood, Shadow Warrior, or anything else, and I only walked
  around E1L1.MAP for a few minutes, but that much looked copacetic.

TO PORT TO NEW PROCESSORS:
- You can either write new ASM for your processor, or better yet, implement
  the stuff in C, so everyone can benefit.
- Most of your work will be in pragmas.*, a_linux.*, and a.*.  Look for
  USE_I386_ASM. Define your own version.
