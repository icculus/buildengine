(questions to Ryan C. Gordon, icculus@lokigames.com)

NEXT ON TAP:
- My god. Almost all of a_linux.asm is self-modifying code.
  Nothing too complex as this stuff goes, but it should be removed,
  none the less.
- Litter the code with assertions.
- ASM->C port for non-intel boxes?
- Look for the string "!!!" ... these are TODOs in the source.
- Tie the window manager quit request to the program, so it reacts like an
  ESC in 3D mode, and a "ESC, Q" in 2D mode. This will allows the user to
  abort the shutdown, save if there are changes, etc...
- Make 2D mode only prompt to save changes on exit if there are changes to
  save.
- Looking up/down in the editor seems to screw things up. This might not be
  the case in 320x200 resolution. Look into it.
- Slopes are misdrawn in kensig.map.
- The timer issue.
- Sound.

// end of TODO ...
