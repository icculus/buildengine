(questions to Ryan C. Gordon, icculus@lokigames.com)

NEXT ON TAP:
- Litter the code with assertions.
- ASM->C port for non-intel boxes?
- Look for the string "!!!" ... these are TODOs in the source.
- Tie the window manager quit request to the program, so it reacts like an
  ESC in 3D mode, and a "ESC, Q" in 2D mode. This will allows the user to
  abort the shutdown, save if there are changes, etc...
- Make 2D mode only prompt to save changes on exit if there are changes to
  save.
- Looking up/down in the editor seems to screw things up. This might not be
  the case in 320x200 resolution. Look into it.
- Slopes are misdrawn in kensig.map.
- Sound.
- Networking.
- Port to Visual C?
- Port to Mingwin32?  (the mprotect()s need to be #ifdef'd out. That should
  be the biggest change.)
- Port to BeOS?
- Make a statically linked binary option in the Linux Makefile.
- Make a linuxbins target (like msbins target) in the Linux Makefile.
- Lose those sound stubs. SDL_mixer support is my vote.

// end of TODO ...
